# **Git Diff Extractor: AI-Powered Insight Through Git Diffs**

### **Overview**

The **Git Diff Extractor** is a powerful desktop application designed to simplify the process of understanding and communicating changes made in Git repositories. Whether you're collaborating with team members or using AI tools to analyze code modifications, this app makes it easy to extract, search, and interpret **Git diffs** in a clear and structured way.

## **Why I Built This?**
The core inspiration behind this tool is **bridging the gap between developers and AI-driven tools**. While Git and version control systems are vital for tracking code changes, understanding the context behind these changes can be tricky. This tool aims to:
- **Streamline communication between you and AI tools** (like ChatGPT) by providing them with **Git diffs** for deeper analysis.
- Help you **understand** what was changed, why it was changed, and how it impacts the broader projectâ€”all through concise, easy-to-read diffs.
- Give you a **visual comparison** between different commits, especially **pull requests** (PRs), so you can dive deeper into how specific tasks were implemented or resolved.

## **Key Features**

1. **Extract Git Diffs**: Extract diffs between two Git commits (especially focused on pull requests) and easily view the code changes made in those commits.

2. **Intelligent PR Display**: Pull requests are displayed in a structured way. Click on any PR to view the detailed diff and even auto-insert commit hashes for further analysis.

3. **Search PRs Easily**: Filter and search through PRs using keywords, commit hashes, or other metadata to quickly find the changes you're looking for.

4. **Highlighting coming soon**: The app supports beautifully colored diffs with syntax highlighting, making it easy to understand what lines were added, removed, or modified.

5. **Smart Hash Extraction**: Uses robust regex-based matching to ensure that **Git commit hashes** are extracted correctly, ensuring reliability even when working with large repositories.

3. **Search PRs**:
   - Use the search bar to quickly filter through PRs using keywords related to commit messages or files changed.

4. **Diff Analysis**:
   - Click on any PR in the list to automatically retrieve and display the Git diff for that commit. This diff can then be fed into AI tools for further analysis and understanding.

5. **Use AI to Understand Diffs**:
   - Once you have the diff displayed, you can copy it and interact with AI tools like ChatGPT to get insights on the changes, ask questions, or receive suggestions.
